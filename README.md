# jupyter-bracket-color
chrome extension to change jupyter notebook matching bracket color

Jupyter notebook changes the color of the bracket just before the cursor.
It is great, but for me, because of partial color blindness, 
the color is indistinct with the bockground. 

This extension is to change the color of the maching bracket.

## how to use

- Download this repo.
- specify the src directory as the unpacket extension.
- The color is hardcorded in the 'shhet.css' file, which you can change as you wish.
